This Perl module extends class accessors with coercing like Moo does. In
addition to Moo, the coercing method gets *all* arguments.

Although designed for use with Moo, this module can also be used independently.

As long as the module has not been published at CPAN, one can install it with
cpanminus >= 1.6 as following:

    cpanm git://github.com/nichtich/Class-Accessor-Coerce.git

Or just download the repository (e.g. by cloning) and call

    make install
